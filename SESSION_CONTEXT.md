# Continuation Briefing

## Project Stack
- Vue 3 + Vite migration from `vue2_project/`.
- Vue Router 4, Pinia, Element Plus, Highcharts, Sass, `<script setup>`.
- API layer uses `src/api/request_provider.js` / `api_request`; stores are Pinia state containers, API work belongs in composables.

## Key Architecture Rules
- Preserve Vue2 behavioral parity; compare with `vue2_project/` before changing migrated behavior.
- Prefer existing composables/helpers/entity config over new local patterns.
- Use `CustomSelectV2` instead of legacy `CustomSelect`; global `CustomSelectV2` / `CustomInput` should not be locally imported unless an existing file already requires that pattern.
- Use `handleEvent`, not `handleEventNew`.
- Dynamic components should use explicit `componentFileLoader` / `formComponentFileLoader`, not legacy string `componentPath`.
- Treat legacy `el-icon-*` strings as CSS classes unless explicitly mapped to Element Plus icon components.
- Do not revert unrelated dirty files. Use `apply_patch` for manual edits.
- User prefers no code/diff output unless requested.

## Current Task Status
- Latest `vue2_project/` changes were synced into already migrated Vue3 files:
  - `src/composables/mixins/useSubItemsList.js` now normalizes boolean `setIfEmpty` values to `0` when false, matching the updated legacy sub-items mixin behavior.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/classes/Chart.js` now disables navigator/scrollbar and enables x panning for `oneChartOnly`.
  - `src/views/Sensors/charts/ChartsListWrapper.vue` now passes per-chart computed `additionalProps`, hides chart headers for single one-chart results, and guards `getParamsByIds` with an array fallback.
  - `src/views/Sensors/sensorForm/ItemForm.vue` now limits Banner M25 running-threshold parameter choices to the updated legacy parameter subset.
- `vue2_project/src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/methods.js` had only whitespace change; no Vue3 functional change was needed.
- WebSocket transport was re-migrated from `vue2_project/src/services/WebSocketService.js` into `src/services/WebSocketService.js`; the service keeps channel authorization, private/presence subscriptions, reconnect/resubscribe, heartbeat, and event handling, with only Vue CLI environment access adapted to Vite.
- `src/composables/mixins/useWebSocket.js` is now the Vue Composition API wrapper around `WebSocketService`, while preserving the existing Vue3 `setupWebSocket` / `closeWebSocket` / `webSocketSend` consumer API.
- Incoming channel events in `useWebSocket` are normalized to the legacy/current consumer contract `{ type, data }`; all existing Vue3 `onMessage` handlers were audited against this shape.
- `useWebSocket` now invokes consumer `onOpen` / legacy `localHandleOpen` only after private-channel subscription succeeds; `localHandleConnected` remains the transport-connected callback. This restores the Vue2 ordering for DXM and FFT requests.
- Full static consumer audit completed: `src/views/Sensors/ItemPage.vue` was the last direct native-WebSocket consumer and now uses `useWebSocket` for its `NCD.COMMAND` result flow. Native `new WebSocket` construction remains only inside `WebSocketService`.
- `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.vue` now starts its idle timer reactively when `authUser` becomes available after the first post-login `get_auth_user()` request, fixing auto-logout only working after a page reload. Existing timeout comments/settings were preserved.
- `src/composables/mixins/useNavigation.js` now captures the injected route object during composable setup and reads its current `fullPath` inside each navigation call. Logout no longer calls `useRoute()` outside setup or receives an undefined/stale route.
- `src/router/index.js` guard was re-aligned with `vue2_project/src/router/beforeEach.js`: query-token authentication now resolves before access checks, the active `GlobalStore.beforeEachHook` can block navigation for unsaved thresholds, and limited-access routes are no longer persisted as post-login redirects. The Vue3 MFA early-return behavior remains intact.
- Targeted ESLint, `git diff --check`, and `npm run build` pass after the WebSocket re-migration.
- Latest verification during the session: targeted `git diff --check` passed; `npm run build` passed with existing Vite mixed-import/chunk-size warnings.
- Follow-up charts_factory parity fix applied:
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/enums.js` now matches Vue2 for `UNIT_TYPES.ULTRASONIC_G`, `constants.usg`, Banner M25 ultrasound RMS/peak unit mapping, and Banner V2.1 localized short names.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/classes/FFTChart.js` now returns `USg` for Banner M25 FFT X waveform / transformed acceleration / X acceleration.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/classes/FFTChart.js` also now uses the Vue2-style RPM cursor drag/update flow: supports `isUpdateOnly`, `serieId` / `pointId`, point title updates, drop-time options sync, and factory-level cursor synchronization.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/classes/FFTChart.js` now builds FFT analysis annotations from `option_value.value` with `custom_value` fallback, matching Vue2 custom-rule behavior.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/classes/StatisticsTransformator.js` now initializes `this.requestsList = []` in the base constructor, matching Vue2 and preventing early `setupDataAccessor()` crashes before request injection.
  - `src/views/Sensors/charts/fft/FFTChartItemContainer.vue` now passes the FFT page Highcharts instance into `ChartWrapper`, restoring annotation/draggable-points module availability for draggable FFT annotations.
  - `src/modules/charts_factory/controllers/Sensor/classes/Chart.js` now guards history-series detection against non-string Highcharts series ids, fixing Banner grouped-by-axis chart mount crashes.
  - Other previously listed charts_factory differences were not changed.
  - `git diff --check` for the touched files and `npm run build` pass.

## Files Already Modified
- Current visible dirty working tree:
  - `src/services/WebSocketService.js`
  - `src/composables/mixins/useWebSocket.js`
  - `src/views/Sensors/FilterBlock/UltrasoundFilterBlock.vue`
  - `src/views/Sensors/ItemPage.vue`
  - `src/components/layout/DashboardLayout.vue`
  - `src/router/index.js`
  - `SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
  - `docs/migration-progress.md`
  - `docs/migration-todos.md`
  - `docs/new-session-handoff.md`
- Do not revert these WebSocket migration changes.

## Unresolved Issues
- No more code-level pending note for `Equipments` advanced tabs; runtime smoke-test was explicitly not requested.
- Remaining open items are runtime-only validation:
  - SuccessDashboard Meeting Tracker / ROI One Pager with real data.
  - Sensors list/create/edit/statistics/FFT/chart routes with real data.
  - Settings, Maintenance, Work Order Requests, StoreRooms, Assets/Machines/Equipments flows as listed in docs.
- Legacy `vue2_project/src/views/Sensors/sensorForm/ItemFormPump.vue` is not present as a separate Vue3 file; pump logic is represented inside the migrated ultrasound form stack.
- `src/views/Sensors/FilterBlock/UltrasoundFilterBlock.vue` now restores the legacy DXM/lubrication flow through `useWebSocket`: it subscribes to the user channel before sending the command, tracks lube-shot data/id, handles controller/status-matched completion, updates charts, and closes the socket.

## Next Actionable Step
- Continue one confirmed file/step at a time; all statically discovered active WebSocket consumers now use the migrated service wrapper, with runtime validation remaining when explicitly requested.
